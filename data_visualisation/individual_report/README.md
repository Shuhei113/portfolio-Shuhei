# Data Visualisation Project – Global Mental Health Map

This project visualizes global prevalence rates of various mental health disorders by country in 1990 and 2021.  
It was created using Processing as part of an individual assignment in the Data Visualization course at Hitotsubashi University.

##  Purpose

The project supports:
- Year switching (1990 vs 2021)
- Disorder switching (Depression, Anxiety, Bipolar Disorder, etc.)
- Interactive hover functionality showing country names and exact values
